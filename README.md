# Multi-variable Imputation 2D (MVI-2D)
## A Physics-Informed Multi-variable Transformer Model for Imputing Missing Solidum Lidar Observations over the Andes
This repository contains code and data fro a multi-variable imputation model designed for atmopsheric data measured by LiDARs. The model incorporates transfomer and convolutional neural networks to perform missing data imputation task.

### Features
**Multivarible input**: Sodium density, wind and temperature data as inputs
